    <p>Never mind the sour cream, farmer's cheese, cream cheese, water bath, and worrying about a sunken center. The
        filling for this delicious cheesecake has just four simple ingredients, and the cake bakes in a mere 30 minutes.
        Now THAT'S easy!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <strong>Crust</strong>
        <li>1½ cups (128g) graham cracker crumbs, 9 to 10 whole graham crackers, crushed</li>
        <li>¼ cup (28g) confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>5⅓ tablespoons (74g) butter, melted</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <strong>Filling</strong>
        <li>1¼ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2½ cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted Vegetable, canola or coconut oil for the pan</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <strong>Step 1</strong>
    <p>Select a pie pan whose inside top dimension is at least 9", and whose height is at least 1 1/4". Preheat the oven
        to 350°F.</p>
    <strong>Step 2</strong>
    <p><strong>To make the crust:</strong> Stir together all of the crust ingredients, mixing until thoroughly combined.
    </p>
    <strong>Step 3</strong>
    <p>Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan, making a thicker layer on the bottom than on
        the sides.</p>
    <strong>Step 4</strong>
    <p><strong>To make the filling:</strong> Mix together the room-temperature cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix
        in the eggs and vanilla, again mixing until smooth. To avoid beating too much air into the batter, use a mixer
        set at low-medium speed. To avoid lumps, make sure the cream cheese is softened, and/or at room temperature.</p>
    <strong>Step 5</strong>
    <p>Set the pie pan onto a baking sheet, if desired; this makes it easier to transport in and out of the oven, and
        also protects the bottom of the crust from any potential scorching. Pour the filling into the crust.</p>
    <strong>Step 6</strong>
    <p><strong>To bake the cheesecake:</strong> Place the cheesecake in the oven. Bake it for 20 minutes, then add a
        crust shield; or shield the crust with strips of aluminum foil. Bake for an additional 10 minutes (for a total
        of about 30 minutes). A digital thermometer inserted into the filling 1" from the edge should read between 165°F
        and 170°F; the filling won't look entirely set in the center.</p>
    <strong>Step 7</strong>
    <p>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and set it on a rack to cool. Once the cake is cool, refrigerate it, covered,
        until you're ready to serve it.</p>
    <strong>Step 8</strong>
    <p>Serve cheesecake in wedges, with fresh fruit if desired.</p>
    <strong>Step 9</strong>
    <p><strong>Storage information:</strong> Store any leftovers in the refrigerator for several days; freeze for longer
        storage.</p>
