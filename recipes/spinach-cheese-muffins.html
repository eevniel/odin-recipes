        kids afternoon snack!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium eggs</li>
        <li>150ml / ½ cup milk</li>
        <li>75g / ½ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>150g / 2 cups grated cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 spring onion, chopped</li>
        <li>75g / 2 cups fresh baby spinach, chopped</li>
        <li>½ red pepper, diced</li>
        <li>250g / 2 cups self raising flour</li>
        <li>½ vegetable stock cube (can use low or no sodium stock cube)</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste (but can be left out)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <strong>Step 1</strong>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 180c / 350f and line a muffin tin with 12 muffin cases.</p>
    <strong>Step 2</strong>
    <p>Gently whisk the eggs in a large bowl and stir in the milk and melted butter. Mix in the grated cheese, spring
        onion, baby spinach and diced pepper.</p>
    <strong>Step 3</strong>
    <p>Finally, add in the flour, salt and pepper (if using) and crumble in the stock cube and mix just enough until all
        the ingredients have combined.</p>
    <strong>Step 4</strong>
    <p>Divide the mixture between the 12 muffin cases and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes until cooked through (a
        skewer stuck into the middle should come out dry).</p>
    <strong>Step 5</strong>
    <p>These muffins can be frozen once they have cooled completely. To defrost simply leave out for a few hours or
        overnight.</p>
