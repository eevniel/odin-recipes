    <p>I enjoy foil-wrapped dinners cooked on the grill, especially because there are no pots or pans to wash. You can
        try making chicken foil packs with most fresh vegetables you have on hand. —Dianna Smith, Newport, Tennessee</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <strong>Makes 2 servings</strong>
        <li>1 large sweet onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>4 large fresh button mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth or stock</li>
        <li>2 boneless skinless chicken breasts (6 ounces each)</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1 medium zucchini, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <strong>Step 1</strong>
    <p>Prepare grill for medium heat or preheat oven to 450°. In a large skillet, cook onion in oil over medium-high
        heat until crisp-tender, 4-5 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook until tender, 4-5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste, basil
        and oregano; cook until tomato paste starts to caramelize, 6-8 minutes. Stir in broth, stirring to loosen
        browned bits from pan. Bring to a boil; cook until sauce has thickened, 8-10 minutes. Remove from heat; cool
        slightly.</p>
    <strong>Step 2</strong>
    <p>Cut each chicken breast into 3 long strips. Divide chicken strips between two 18x12-in. pieces of heavy-duty
        nonstick foil, placing food on dull side of foil; sprinkle with salt and pepper and top with zucchini. Spoon
        tomato mixture over zucchini. Fold foil around mixture, sealing tightly.</p>
    <strong>Step 3</strong>
    <p>Place packets on grill or in oven; cook until chicken is no longer pink, 15-20 minutes, turning once. Open
        packets carefully to allow steam to escape. If desired, top with additional basil.</p>
